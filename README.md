# Fake-News-Detection
Fake News Detection using Python

In this project, we have used various natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify fake news articles using sci-kit libraries from python.

In this there are mainly two data set one is fake and another is true.

We divide dataset into two part 1. training 2. testing

We shuffle combined training dataset to train model then we find efficiency with the help of combined testing dataset.
